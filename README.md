Simple Graph
============

Simple Graph (SG) is a javascript library for representing graphs.
It depends on Buckets (https://github.com/mauriciosantos/buckets).
The library is still in development. Unit tests need to be written. Not everything is documented. Visualization needs to be written. If you want to contribute, please do :)

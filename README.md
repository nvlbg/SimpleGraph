Simple Graph
============

Simple Graph (sg) is a javascript library for representing graphs.
It depends on Buckets (https://github.com/mauriciosantos/buckets).
The library is still in development. Unit tests need to be written. Not everything is documented. Visualization needs to be written. If you want to contribute, please do :)

Building documentation
----------------------

First, you must install yuidoc - http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/
Then, you must cd to the src/ folder and run
`$ yuidoc .`
